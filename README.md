# Development-of-a-special-table-for-FABLAB-MISIS
This is a learning task on the subject of "Product Design" in the master's degree program of MISIS

## User's portrait

A questionnaire was created to create a portrait of the user. We have not been provided with any detailed information on how to assemble a user's portrait in this application.

**Work plan**:

* Creating a questionnaire

* Conducting a survey

* Collecting results

* Adding the results to the table

* Data analysis and creation of a card with a portrait of the user


### User's portrait 1.0

Several of my classmates took part in the survey - 2-year masters of MISIS and our teacher. This does not cover the entire target audience of users, but it allows you to create an idea of how to conduct a survey in more detail for a wider audience of respondents-users of the audience.

To complete the task, I used an iPad 9 series, an apple pencil of the 1st generation. The primary results were recorded in the form of screenshots in the lesson summary, which I conduct using the [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com) software on my Ipad.  


**Creating a questionnaire**

Here is my initial questionnaire

The data was entered in the [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFpNEpan8OwdX6MtDrM4EFjOio6TkwWlqCSvYgD193o/edit?usp=sharing)  

**Data analysis:** 

6 respondents were interviewed, 17% of them were teachers, 83% were master's students with 2 years of study. Common patterns were identified among them, on the basis of which the primary portrait of the user was compiled.

The visualization of the user's portrait was created using the Keynote Software on a MacBook (Apple)
